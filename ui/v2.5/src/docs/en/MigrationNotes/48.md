This migration removes the unused `scraped_items` table from the database, which was only used in very old versions of Stash. For the vast majority of users, it should be empty, but if not, the migration will fail and restore the old database. If this happens, please manually edit the database and remove the table yourself, after making a copy of any contained data you'd like to keep. If you are not confident on how to do this, feel free to ask for assistance on the Discord server.

This migration also enforces studio name uniqueness at the database level. Although no longer possible in recent versions, older versions of Stash allowed for different studios to have identical names. If your database has such duplicate names, the duplicates will have `" (1)"`, `" (2)"`, etc. appended to their names after this migration.
